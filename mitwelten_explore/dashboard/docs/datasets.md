# Datasets

This page gives an overview of the datasets that are available in this tool.

## Meteodata

[Select data](select/meteo)


Meteodata are provided by [Meteo Schweiz](https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/).
The parameters are available in raw form and as aggregated values, with the aggregation described in the respective parameter name.


## Bird Dataset


See [Mitwelten.org](https://www.mitwelten.org/)


`detections` represent recognized bird songs. It is possible that certain species are more active than others.

A direct comparison of detections can only be made with additional information about a species.

## Pax Data

A PAX Counter is a system that counts smartphones. As part of the Mitwelten project, PAX counters were developed that receive periodically transmitted signals from smartphones and transmit the number of unique smartphones within a radius of a few meters as a measured value. The sum of the detected devices per time interval is transmitted. If a device is in range over several measurement intervals, it is counted in each measurement. For PAX counters connected via WiFi, the measurement interval is much smaller than for LoRa devices, which makes a direct comparison impossible.


## Pollinators


[Select data](select/pollinator)

As part of the Mitwelten project, a pollinator study was conducted. Flower pots were placed at various locations. Cameras were used to take pictures of the flowers at regular intervals.
On the captured images, flowers are cut out with an ML object recognition model, on which pollinators are recognized in a second step.
